          <li>Out on the first date but donâ€™t feel like having either party to foot the bill? Surprise them by PEx-ing the money to his / her mobile number.</li>
          <li>Lend a helping hand! Your little brother or sister is stuck in college and has no money for lunch and the taxi fare home. Just PEx the money to their mobile number.</li>
          <li>Mobile numbers are easier to remember and normally stored in your phone contacts. Transfer money to a mobile number is much easier than to an account number.</li>
